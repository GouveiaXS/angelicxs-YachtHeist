# angelicxs-YachtHeist

Hi all, 
I realized that there is a sever lack of free Yacht Heists availble for users to select from so I have gone ahead and provided you one.
As usual this is ESX and QBCore compatable with an easy config to navigate. The dependencies can be changed/removed if you know what you are doing. Every step is synced so all users are able to hack/loot etc at the same time (unable to duplicate looting unless they are basically frame perfect)


Youtube Preview: TBA


Heist Overview:

1. Users will talk to inital NPC to start heist.

2. Users will need to succesfully beat the minigame at all four engines to allow progression

3. After minigames are compelted and next step is initalized the lootable areas within the ship will open.

4A. If NOT using a third-eye system they will only be able to loot the trolley's with money.

4B. If using a third-eye system they will be able to explore the ship for additional loot.

5. After the aloted time entire boat will be reset and job can be done again.


Dependencies

ps-ui (for minigames)

xSound (for engine noise on game fail)
